# Multilang-C-Cpp-Headers
This header-project maps the keywords from C and C++ to the equvalent in different languages.

## Why do I do that project, you might ask?

- If you found that project before you go/fell asleep
    - You don't need answers, you need sleep.

- If you found it because you sit on the toilet to avoid your duties
    - Go down from that damn thing and do your duties.

- If you found that project because you doomscrolled through short form videos or through Github or through a random article
    - Go start your own programming project and learn something during that or 
    - you learn something else or
    - do something else fun

- If you found that because you look for a (useful and helpful) header/project for work
    - This is not the thing you looked for.

- For everyone else
    - You can use that project in your own open source projects to confuse the people that find your projects.

## Where did I get the idea from?
I hope you know what a toilet is. If not, WTF are you doing with your life?

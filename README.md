# Multilang-C-Cpp-Headers
This header-project maps the keywords from C and C++ to the equvalent in different languages.

## Why do I do that project, you might ask?

- If you found that project before you go/fell asleep
  - You don't need answers, you need sleep.

- If you found it because you sit on the toilet to avoid your duties
  - Go down from that damn thing and do your duties.

- If you found that project because you doomscrolled through short form videos or through Github or through a random article
  - Go start your own programming project and learn something during that or
  - you learn something else or
  - do something else fun or
  - You can use that project in your own open source projects to confuse the people that find your projects or
  - You can help to update and correct the headers and/or learn a new language (better)

- If you found that because you look for a (useful and helpful) header/project for work
  - This is not the thing you looked for.

- For everyone else
  - You can use that project in your own open source projects to confuse the people that find your projects.
  - You can help to update and correct the headers and/or learn a new language (better)

## Where did I get the idea from?
I hope you know what a toilet is. If not, WTF are you doing with your life?

## Is there any benefit from contribute to that project, even when it is silly?
Yes it is, and not just one. What are they you might ask? Let me list a few:

- You learn a new language.
- You can help to keep a language alive, like Vallader and/or Puter, which are already fetured in that Repo, by learning them and maybe even create new content by updating this Repo and help others to improve in that language, or by spreading the laguage by using this header in your project, so that other start to learn it.
